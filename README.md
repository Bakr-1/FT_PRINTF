# 💡FT_PRINTF
•This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

•The prototype of ft_printf() is:

    -int ft_printf(const char *, ...);

# ❗️REQUIREMENT 
You have to implement the following conversions:

• %c Prints a single character.

• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).

• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.

• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.

• %i Prints an integer in base 10.

• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.

• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.

• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.

• %% Prints a percent sign.
